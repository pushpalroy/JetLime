 * Represents the styling configuration for [JetLimeColumn] and [JetLimeRow] components.

 * This class encapsulates various properties that define the appearance and layout of [JetLimeColumn] and [JetLimeRow] components,
 * such as content distance, item spacing, line thickness, and alignment properties. It provides a fluent API
 * for modifying these properties.
 *
 * - See [JetLimeDefaults.columnStyle] for the default style in a [JetLimeColumn].
 * - See [JetLimeDefaults.rowStyle] for the default style in a [JetLimeRow].
 *
 * @param contentDistance The distance of content from the start of the JetLime component.
 * @param itemSpacing The spacing between items in the JetLime component.
 * @param lineThickness The thickness of the line in the JetLime component.
 * @param lineBrush The brush used for the line in the JetLime component.
 * @param pathEffect the effect applied to the geometry of the timeline to obtain a dashed pattern.
 * @param lineHorizontalAlignment The horizontal alignment of the line in the JetLime component.
 * @param lineVerticalAlignment The vertical alignment of the line in the JetLime component.
